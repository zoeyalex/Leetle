# 1. FizzBuzz
Write a function `solve` that takes a number `n` and returns a list of numbers from 1 to `n`. If the number is divisible by 3, replace it with 'Fizz'. If the number is divisible by 5, replace it with 'Buzz'. If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, replace it with 'FizzBuzz'.

**Example**:\
`Input: 15`\
`Output: [1, 2, 'Fizz', 4, 'Buzz', 'Fizz', 7, 8, 'Fizz', 'Buzz', 11, 'Fizz', 13, 14, 'FizzBuzz']`
# 2. Single Number
Write a function `solve` that finds the number that appears only once in a list where all other numbers appear twice.

**Example**:\
`Input: [4,1,2,1,2]`\
`Output: 4 `

Make sure you `return` your solution, don't print!
