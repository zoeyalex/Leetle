# 1. FizzBuzz
Write a function `solve` that takes a number `n` and returns a list of numbers from 1 to `n`. If the number is divisible by 3, replace it with 'Fizz'. If the number is divisible by 5, replace it with 'Buzz'. If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, replace it with 'FizzBuzz'.

**Example**:\
`Input: 15`\
`Output: [1, 2, 'Fizz', 4, 'Buzz', 'Fizz', 7, 8, 'Fizz', 'Buzz', 11, 'Fizz', 13, 14, 'FizzBuzz']`
# 2. Single Number
Write a function `solve` that finds the number that appears only once in a list where all other numbers appear twice.

**Example**:\
`Input: [4,1,2,1,2]`\
`Output: 4 `
# 3. Majority Element
Write a function `solve` that finds the majority element in a list. The majority element appears more than n/2 times where n is the length of the list.

**Example**:\
`Input: [3,2,3]`\
`Output: 3 `
# 4. Missing Number
Write a function `solve` that finds the missing number in a list of numbers from 0 to n. The list is missing one number.

**Example**:\
`Input: [3,0,1]`\
`Output: 2 `
# 5. Valid Anagram
Write a function `solve` that determines if two strings are anagrams of each other. An anagram is a word formed by rearranging the letters of another word.

**Example**:\
`Input: "listen", "silent"`\
`Output: true `
# 6. Maximum Subarray
Write a function `solve` that finds the contiguous subarray with the largest sum in a list.

**Example**:\
`Input: [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4]`\
`Output: 6 `
# 7. Valid Parentheses
Write a function `solve` that determines if a string `s` of parentheses is valid. Valid parentheses must be closed in the correct order.

**Example**:\
`Input: "()[]{}"`\
`Output: True `
# 8. Two Sum
Write a function `solve` that finds two numbers in a list that add up to a target value. Return a list with their indices in order. If the target cannot be made, return an empty list.

**Example**:\
`Input: [2, 7, 11, 15], target=9`\
`Output: [0, 1] `
# 9. Sliding Window Maximum
Write a function `solve` that returns the maximum number in each window of size k sliding from left to right in a list. Your function should return a list of ints.

**Example**:\
`Input: [1,3,-1,-3,5,3,6,7], k=3`\
`Output: [3,3,5,5,6,7] `
# 10. First Missing Positive
Write a function `solve` that finds the first missing positive integer given an unsorted list. That is, the smallest positive integer not in the list.

**Example**:\
`Input: [3,4,-1,1]`\
`Output: 2 `
